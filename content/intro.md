Which <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> character inspired the most hatred among the fans? Cersei? Ramsay? Surely Joffrey and his sneers must have earned him the title, right? And how about the reverse: which characters were perennial fan favorites? Tormund? Arya? Pod the Rod?

I found myself asking these questions recently. In July, I finished watching through the series for the first time, and because I'm late to the game, I wondered if the way I felt about various characters or moments was in line with how fans had reacted to the show as it unfolded in real time.
