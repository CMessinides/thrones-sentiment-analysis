Which <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> character inspired the most hatred among the fans? Cersei? Ramsay? Surely Joffrey and his sneers must have earned him the title, right? And how about the reverse: which characters were perennial fan favorites? Tormund? Arya? Pod the Rod?

I found myself asking these questions recently; in July, I finished watching through the series for the first time. Luckily, <cite>Thrones</cite> fans have not been shy about sharing their feelings online. In particular, three subreddits&mdash;[/r/gameofthrones](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones), [r/asoiaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf), and [/r/freefolk](https://wwww.reddit.com/r/freefolk)&mdash;have archived discussion threads for all 73 episodes with thousands of fan comments.

I was only able to find discussion threads in /r/freefolk for Season 8, but threads in the other two go all the way back to Season 1.

In an attempt to answer my questions, I scraped a bunch of those Reddit comments (300,101 to be exact) and ran them through a sentiment analyzer. Next, I searched them for sentences that mentioned prominent characters and analyzed those sentences as well. The end result is a big heap of sentiment scores that allow us to see (roughly) how fans felt about a character at any given point in the series.

The rest of this essay will use those results to try to figure out which <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> characters won fans over and which ones were unforgivable. But first, let's cut through the jargon: what *is* sentiment analysis?
