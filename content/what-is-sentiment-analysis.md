## What is Sentiment Analysis?

<aside>

Case in point: an earlier draft of this essay included Ghost, Jon's direwolf, as a character &mdash; that was, until I checked the results and found that on average, sentences that mentioned Ghost were by far the most negative of any character. That's because the word "ghost" has [a moderately negative sentiment rating of -1.3 in VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/b045da3c5a29ed130777a16dc78588f53da54a05/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L3254).

In an ideal world, I would use a sentiment analyzer tuned to the language of <cite>Game of Thrones</cite>, where "Ghost" could be a neutral word, but I have neither the expertise nor the resources to create such a tool. VADER works well enough for 99 percent of characters in the series, but unfortunately for Ghost, [we'll have to leave our dear direwolf behind](https://youtu.be/8JFwkRcpukk?t=173) for this project.
